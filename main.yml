# This structure bootstraps and configures all Homelab hosts consistently using Ansible.
# 
# Step 1: Run common setup tasks (timezone, sudo, etc.) across all hosts.
# Step 2: Use group-specific role lists (from group_vars) to apply tailored configurations.
# Step 3: Dynamically execute only relevant roles per host/group based on `default_roles` and optional tag filtering.
#
# Note: Role execution can be filtered by tag (e.g. --tags base), and supports optional `exclude_roles` in group_vars/host_vars.
