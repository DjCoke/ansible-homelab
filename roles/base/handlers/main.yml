  # This handler reboots the node using the 'ansible.builtin.reboot' module.
  # The 'reboot_timeout' sets the maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the system to reboot and reconnect.
  # The task checks if the node is not a Proxmox host before rebooting, as Proxmox nodes generally manage reboots differently.
